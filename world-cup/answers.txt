Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

10 simulations gave incorrect predictions.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I would say around 10000.
